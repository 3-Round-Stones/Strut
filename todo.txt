-We need the storage interface to be completely generic (i.e. reusable across projects)
	-So we need to split that storage bundle into the generic storage interface
	and the strut specific storage interface.
->Re-visit all components and split them according to the above advice.
->Re-visit wrappers (e.g., storageProviderWrapper) and update to use ServiceCollection.

-Re-visit the command structure and redo/undo
-Multi select
-Re-visit keyboard shortcut handling.
-Make place component smarter
-Handle z-ordering on slides
